hello iam sruthy. iam here to talk about some interestiing facts about myself. let me tell you first of all that iam not fit for anything ,so its better if you dont give me any job.
another fact about myself is that iam an idiot too. so these are all of the facts about myself so yeah i will definitely let you know about that later on.

that was my negative sided personality. To be honest iam more of a half pessissimistic and other half of a optimistic side. So lets look at the optimistic side. Very long time ago i had to take a very crucial decisionin my life. It was my about my undergraduation degree, I had to take a major decision that is going for engineering or any other science course. And i finally took a decision is to die, Thankyou
